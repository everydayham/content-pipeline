      "description": "<p>What does 2026 have in store for ham radio? A year into the podcast, James (K8JKU), Jim (N8JRD), and Rory (W8KNX) turn up the dial with a forward look at the hobby's near future \u2014 grounded in real gear, real operating, and real community.<br><br>We start in the shack with winter POTA prep, a feather-light 33-foot mast, a fiber-fueled network overhaul, and a pair of pristine rotary phones begging for a ham project. Then we get into the predictions.<br><br>On the gear side, we share our predictions for what hardware might be on the horizon \u2014 what we'd love to see from the major manufacturers and where we think the industry is heading.<br><br>But hardware isn't the whole story. POTA and SOTA remain the heartbeat of growth because they lower the barrier to entry and make radio feel alive. We share why portable operating will keep rising even as solar conditions tighten.<br><br>At home, we're betting on a repeater revival \u2014 AllStar links, creative nets like SSTV nights, and \"leave no call unanswered\" as the culture shift that keeps VHF/UHF useful and welcoming. College clubs are buzzing again, and the formula scales: be kind, run practical events, and meet people where they are \u2014 on-air, at meetups, or on Discord.<br><br>AI comes up, minus the hype. Think helpful, not magical: audio-assisted logging, smarter noise control, and developer tooling that speeds up ham software. It's another tool, like a good tuner \u2014 valuable when it saves time and stays out of the way.<br><br>We wrap with personal goals \u2014 Extra class ambitions and a fresh pull toward CW \u2014 and a reminder that every license class is valid.

We open with momentum\u2014POTA activations, contest firsts, and new video drops\u2014then move straight into the issue shaping the future of the hobby: ARRL\u2019s grassroots effort to pass the Amateur Radio Emergency Preparedness Act (HR 1094/S.459). If HOAs block antennas where most new homes are built, fewer operators will get on the air. We explain the stakes, the opposition from CAI, and the surprisingly easy way to send a letter that reaches your representatives in minutes.<br><br>We also get practical about life in the shack and on the road. Running 500 to 1,000 watts through contest weekend revealed where filters shine and where they need tuning, and winter prep is now or never\u2014check matches, weatherproof connectors, and tighten your grounding. On the mobile side, an EV install in a Mach\u2011E delivered clean VHF/UHF performance with smart power routing and a 3D\u2011printed head mount, plus notes on AM noise under acceleration. If you\u2019ve avoided EVs for RF reasons, this is a reality check rooted in measurements, not myths.<br><br>Gear watchers get plenty to chew on. The Icom IC\u20117300 Mark II looks set to land around $1,499, squaring up against the Yaesu FTdx10 with modernized I/O and familiar ease of use. But the U.S. government shutdown is delaying FCC certifications across categories, which could push new radio launches past the holidays. Meanwhile, used IC\u20117300 prices are compelling, making it a standout first HF rig. We wrap with FlexRadio\u2019s SmartSDR 4.0\u2014meaningful noise\u2011reduction improvements, a flexible subscription model, and a few early\u2011release quirks to monitor.<br><br>If you care about the bands staying lively and accessible, this conversation matters.

In this episode, we step away from our usual Parks on the Air discussions to explore the thrilling world of mountaintop radio operations with two accomplished SOTA enthusiasts.<br><br>Meet Matt W7MDN, a pilot from Spokane who combines trail running and snowshoeing with radio, and Tim N7KOM, a mountaineer and YouTube creator from Bend who's known for his ultralight setups. Both have achieved the prestigious Mountain Goat award, representing 1,000 activation points earned by operating from mountain summits.<br><br>We unpack the fundamental differences between POTA and SOTA \u2013 while parks often allow drive-up operations with 100-watt rigs, SOTA requires reaching designated activation zones near peaks with equipment disconnected from vehicles. The equipment philosophy shifts dramatically too, with most SOTA operators using 5-10 watt radios like the MTR3 or Elecraft KX2, paired with lightweight wire antennas that can be quickly deployed.<br><br>The conversation dives into the meticulous planning required for SOTA activations, from researching access permissions to preparing for safety contingencies. Matt and Tim share their favorite activation stories, including Matt's Mountain Goat qualification during a January snowshoe expedition and Tim's sunrise celebration atop Mount McLaughlin complete with ceremonial goat horns.<br><br>Whether you're an experienced operator looking for a new challenge or simply curious about combining outdoor adventure with radio, this episode provides a comprehensive introduction to SOTA. You'll learn about the points system, equipment recommendations, online resources, and the thriving community that makes this radio sport so rewarding.<br><br>Ready to climb a mountain with your radio? This might just be the inspiration you need to earn those summit points and breathtaking views!</p>",

      "description": "<p>The tides of amateur radio innovation ebb and flow as manufacturers take turns showcasing their latest technological marvels. While Yaesu dominated last year's Tokyo Ham Fair with the FTX1, this year unquestionably belonged to ICOM, who unveiled two significant new radios that have the ham community buzzing with anticipation.<br><br>ICOM's IC-7300 Mark II represents a thoughtful evolution of what has become perhaps the most popular HF radio of the past decade. Rather than reinventing the wheel, ICOM listened carefully to user feedback, maintaining the beloved form factor while modernizing crucial aspects. The enhanced receiver offers 12dB better noise performance, addressing one of the few criticisms of the original \u2013 its performance in crowded band conditions. Lower power consumption and 23% less heat generation make it more field-operation friendly, while connectivity gets a complete overhaul with HDMI output, USB-C with dual COM functionality, and SMA receiver antenna ports.<br><br>Equally exciting is the ID-5200 mobile radio, which finally brings ICOM's VHF/UHF mobile lineup into the modern era with a vibrant color touchscreen replacing the aging monochrome display of the ID-5100. Evidence suggests it may include native APRS functionality \u2013 a feature long requested by ICOM users \u2013 alongside Wi-Fi for internal D-STAR gateway functionality without requiring an external hotspot. Though still \"under glass\" as a concept, this hybrid-interface radio maintains ICOM's reputation for intuitive menu systems while adding modern connectivity options.<br><br>Perhaps most encouraging for the hobby was Uniden's return to the Ham Fair after a 40-year absence, potentially signaling renewed corporate interest in amateur radio markets. As manufacturers continue pushing innovation forward with substantial upgrades rather than incremental changes, there's never been a more exciting time to explore the evolving world of amateur radio technology. Which of these new offerings has captured your interest, and what features would you like to see in future ham radio developments?</p>",

      "description": "<p>What happens when the \"Super Bowl of Amateur Radio\" meets poor band conditions? The Everyday Ham team breaks down their 2025 ARRL Field Day experience with honest reflection about what worked, what didn't, and why it still matters.</p><p>Despite challenging propagation that made 20 meters nearly useless, our South Lyon Area Amateur Radio Club (SLAARC) field operation managed 680 QSOs with 16 operators including several first-timers making their debut HF contacts. The camaraderie and mentorship moments proved more memorable than any score could reflect.</p><p>Our equipment choices sparked fascinating discussion about the evolution of field operations. We deployed simple yet effective antennas including Aerial-51 off-center fed dipoles on SOTA-beam masts and a remarkable military surplus 40-meter vertical built from scrap aluminum by silent key Larry K8UT that outperformed expectations. All stations used FTDX10 radios - a choice we explain after detailing our final journey away from problematic FTX1 models and praising Ham Radio Outlet's exceptional customer service.</p><p>The most thought-provoking segment explores whether POTA is replacing traditional Field Day. With outdoor portable operation now happening year-round, we question how ARRL might evolve Field Day to maintain relevance, particularly addressing the controversial 1D station rules. An 82-year-old ham's perspective that \"POTA is the future of ham radio\" launches us into examining the balance between contesting, emergency practice, and social connection.</p><p>Join us for laughs about Jim's abandoned attempt to backpack a DX10 to Mackinac Island, heated debates about \"please copy\" Field Day etiquette, and news about our exciting guest for Episode 8 - someone from one of the \"big three\" manufacturers you won't want to miss!</p><p><b>Subscribe:</b> <a href=\"https://www.everydayham.com\">https://www.everydayham.com</a></p><p>If you enjoy the Everyday Ham Podcast, please leave a five-star review - it helps others find us and keeps this conversation growing.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The long-awaited Yaesu FTX1 Optima has finally arrived in ham shacks across America, but does it live up to the hype? We've spent days testing Yaesu's latest flagship and share our unfiltered experiences that left us reaching for our trusty FT-891s instead. From PTT issues that drop mid-transmission to strange menu bugs and disappointing receiver performance compared to the FT-710 and FT-DX10, we dive deep into what went wrong and whether firmware updates can save this premium-priced radio.</p><p>In a surprising market development, we explore the news that SteppIR has announced their exit from the amateur radio consumer market by August 2025. Their CEO cites an aging ham population moving to stealth antennas as HOAs restrict traditional towers. Is this the beginning of a larger trend in ham radio manufacturing following MFJ's recent exit, or simply market evolution as the hobby changes?</p><p>Summer is here, and that means Field Day is just around the corner! Whether you're a newly licensed ham nervous about your first HF contact or an experienced operator looking to test emergency preparedness, we share why Field Day (June 28-29) offers something for everyone. From operating tips to overcoming microphone fright, discover why this annual event remains amateur radio's most beloved gathering.</p><p>The amateur radio landscape continues to shift, with new technologies promising innovation while established companies retreat from changing markets. Through it all, what matters most is finding the gear and activities that spark joy in your radio journey. What's working for you this summer?</p>",

Despite challenging band conditions, he managed to work over 40 Michigan counties and came away with a respectable score. His experiences highlight the perfect use case for Yaesu's new offering\u2014a radio that can transition seamlessly from powerful base station to lightweight field unit.&nbsp;</p><p>With Hamvention rapidly approaching, we share our strategies for making the most of ham radio's biggest event. From forum recommendations (don't miss the POTA sessions!) to flea market tactics and practical advice about staying comfortable in the heat, we offer insights that will help first-timers and veterans alike. We'll be camping at Caesar Creek in the D-E loops and would love to meet listeners who are attending.&nbsp;</p><p>The FTX-1F Optima's impressive feature set includes dual antenna ports, built-in antenna tuner with memory, and modern USB-C connectivity for both data and power delivery. While not perfect\u2014no true dual receive for satellite operations and no separation cable option for mobile installation\u2014the radio represents a significant leap forward in transceiver design that may influence the direction of amateur radio equipment for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Grab your comfortable shoes, sunscreen, and shopping list\u2014we're heading to Hamvention!
