        "description": "What does 2026 have in store for ham radio? In this episode of Everyday Ham, James (K8JKU), Jim (N8JRD), and Rory (W8KNX) share their bold predictions for the year ahead \u2014 covering new rigs, the future of our community, and what's next for the hobby.\n\nWe start in the shack with winter POTA prep, a feather-light 33-foot mast, a fiber-fueled network overhaul, and a pair of pristine rotary phones begging for a ham project. Then we dig into the predictions.\n\nOn the gear side, we share our predictions for what hardware might be on the horizon \u2014 what we'd love to see from the major manufacturers and where we think the industry is heading.\n\nBut hardware isn't the whole story. We spend time on community \u2014 why POTA and SOTA remain the heartbeat of growth, how repeaters can make a comeback through AllStar links and creative nets, and why \"leave no call unanswered\" might be the culture shift that keeps VHF/UHF alive and welcoming. College clubs are buzzing again, and the formula scales: be kind, run practical events, and meet people where they are.\n\nWe also talk AI in ham radio (helpful, not magical), and wrap with personal goals \u2014 Extra class ambitions and a fresh pull toward CW.\n\n\ud83d\udcfb TIMESTAMPS\n0:00 \u2013 Intro\n0:25 \u2013 Year One Milestone & Housekeeping\n1:03 \u2013 Meet the Hosts and Shacks\n1:30 \u2013 Thanksgiving Deals and Rotary Phone Idea\n2:50 \u2013 Cold Weather POTA and Heated Mat\n4:54 \u2013 New Mast, Networking, and Fiber Upgrade\n7:21 \u2013 Main Topic: Predictions for 2026\n7:49 \u2013 Recent Radio Releases Recap\n10:10 \u2013 Kenwood TM-D750A: When and Why\n12:47 \u2013 Could Kenwood Cancel the 750A\n15:59 \u2013 Next Big Releases: HF, HTs, and USB-C\n18:24 \u2013 705 Mark II and Handheld Iterations\n25:42 \u2013 Growing the Community: Younger Hams\n28:20 \u2013 Clubs, Mentors, and Being Welcoming\n31:52 \u2013 Will POTA and SOTA Keep Rising\n35:45 \u2013 Reviving Repeaters and Creative Nets\n40:06 \u2013 Wild Cards: AI's Real Role in 2026\n44:48 \u2013 Extra Class Goals and CW Aspirations\n48:42 \u2013 Community Shoutouts and Content Plans\n50:41 \u2013 Closing Thanks and Holiday 73\n\n\ud83d\udd17 LINKS & RESOURCES\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: https://www.everydayham.com\n\ud83d\udcf7 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/everydayhampodcast/\n\ud83d\udcac Discord: Join our community at everydayham.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 LISTEN TO THE AUDIO PODCAST\nAvailable on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, and more!\nFind all links at: https://www.everydayham.com\n\nWhat rig are you hoping to see in 2026?

In this episode of Everyday Ham, James (K8JKU), Jim (N8JRD), and Rory (W8KNX) share their bold predictions for the year ahead \u2014 covering new rigs, the future of our community, and what's next for the hobby.\n\nWe start in the shack with winter POTA prep, a feather-light 33-foot mast, a fiber-fueled network overhaul, and a pair of pristine rotary phones begging for a ham project. Then we dig into the predictions.\n\nOn the gear side, we share our predictions for what hardware might be on the horizon \u2014 what we'd love to see from the major manufacturers and where we think the industry is heading.\n\nBut hardware isn't the whole story. We spend time on community \u2014 why POTA and SOTA remain the heartbeat of growth, how repeaters can make a comeback through AllStar links and creative nets, and why \"leave no call unanswered\" might be the culture shift that keeps VHF/UHF alive and welcoming. College clubs are buzzing again, and the formula scales: be kind, run practical events, and meet people where they are.\n\nWe also talk AI in ham radio (helpful, not magical), and wrap with personal goals \u2014 Extra class ambitions and a fresh pull toward CW.\n\n\ud83d\udcfb TIMESTAMPS\n0:00 \u2013 Intro\n0:25 \u2013 Year One Milestone & Housekeeping\n1:03 \u2013 Meet the Hosts and Shacks\n1:30 \u2013 Thanksgiving Deals and Rotary Phone Idea\n2:50 \u2013 Cold Weather POTA and Heated Mat\n4:54 \u2013 New Mast, Networking, and Fiber Upgrade\n7:21 \u2013 Main Topic: Predictions for 2026\n7:49 \u2013 Recent Radio Releases Recap\n10:10 \u2013 Kenwood TM-D750A: When and Why\n12:47 \u2013 Could Kenwood Cancel the 750A\n15:59 \u2013 Next Big Releases: HF, HTs, and USB-C\n18:24 \u2013 705 Mark II and Handheld Iterations\n25:42 \u2013 Growing the Community: Younger Hams\n28:20 \u2013 Clubs, Mentors, and Being Welcoming\n31:52 \u2013 Will POTA and SOTA Keep Rising\n35:45 \u2013 Reviving Repeaters and Creative Nets\n40:06 \u2013 Wild Cards: AI's Real Role in 2026\n44:48 \u2013 Extra Class Goals and CW Aspirations\n48:42 \u2013 Community Shoutouts and Content Plans\n50:41 \u2013 Closing Thanks and Holiday 73\n\n\ud83d\udd17 LINKS & RESOURCES\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: https://www.everydayham.com\n\ud83d\udcf7 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/everydayhampodcast/\n\ud83d\udcac Discord: Join our community at everydayham.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 LISTEN TO THE AUDIO PODCAST\nAvailable on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, and more!\nFind all links at: https://www.everydayham.com\n\nWhat rig are you hoping to see in 2026?

        "title": "Can You Put Up An Antenna? The HOA Bill Fight & IC-7300 Mark II",
        "description": "A thousand subscribers may be a milestone, but the real win is what it represents: a growing community of hams trading ideas, trying new modes, and pushing for the right to put real antennas on real roofs. We open with momentum\u2014POTA activations, contest firsts, and new video drops\u2014then move straight into the issue shaping the future of the hobby: ARRL\u2019s grassroots effort to pass the Amateur Radio Emergency Preparedness Act (HR 1094/S.459). If HOAs block antennas where most new homes are built, fewer operators will get on the air. We explain the stakes, the opposition from CAI, and the surprisingly easy way to send a letter that reaches your representatives in minutes.\n\nWe also get practical about life in the shack and on the road. Running 500 to 1,000 watts through contest weekend revealed where filters shine and where they need tuning, and winter prep is now or never\u2014check matches, weatherproof connectors, and tighten your grounding. On the mobile side, an EV install in a Mach\u2011E delivered clean VHF/UHF performance with smart power routing and a 3D\u2011printed head mount, plus notes on AM noise under acceleration. If you\u2019ve avoided EVs for RF reasons, this is a reality check rooted in measurements, not myths.\n\nGear watchers get plenty to chew on. The Icom IC\u20117300 Mark II looks set to land around $1,499, squaring up against the Yaesu FTdx10 with modernized I/O and familiar ease of use. But the U.S. government shutdown is delaying FCC certifications across categories, which could push new radio launches past the holidays. Meanwhile, used IC\u20117300 prices are compelling, making it a standout first HF rig.

          "description": "My go-to portable power and radio setup for POTA! The Bioenno 12V 6Ah battery stays under TSA limits and pairs perfectly with my FT-891 for Parks on the Air activations. Why I love this combo: airline-friendly, no battery anxiety, and the modular bag setup lets me swap between portable and mobile operations. The FT-891 is my go-to preferred radio - I actually have 2 of them! Perfect beginner setup for park activations.

        "description": "Ever wondered what happens when you combine hiking, mountaineering, and ham radio? In Episode 9 of Everyday Ham, James (K8JKU), Jim (N8JRD), and Rory (W8KNX) step away from their usual Parks on the Air discussions to explore the thrilling world of Summits on the Air (SOTA) with experts Matt W7MDN and Tim @N7KOM  from the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMeet Matt, a pilot from Spokane who combines trail running and snowshoeing with radio, and Tim, a mountaineer and YouTube creator from Bend known for his ultralight setups. Both have achieved the prestigious Mountain Goat Award, representing 1,000 activation points earned by operating from mountain summits.\n\nWe unpack the fundamental differences between POTA and SOTA \u2013 while parks often allow drive-up operations with 100-watt rigs, SOTA requires reaching designated activation zones near peaks with equipment disconnected from vehicles. The equipment philosophy shifts dramatically too, with most SOTA operators using 5-10 watt radios like the LNR MTR3B or Elecraft KX2, paired with lightweight wire antennas.\n\nThe conversation covers the meticulous planning required for SOTA activations, safety considerations, and CW learning tips.

Our guests share their favorite activations, including Matt's Mountain Goat qualification during a January snowshoe expedition and Tim's sunrise celebration atop Mount McLaughlin complete with ceremonial goat horns.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\nSOTA vs POTA differences and similarities\nUltralight radio gear (LNR MTR3B, Elecraft KX2, Elecraft KH1)\nMountain Goat Award requirements (1000 activator points)\nSafety planning and property access considerations\nCW learning resources and techniques\nSummit-to-summit (S2S) contacts\nOregon SOTA Campout highlights\n\nTimestamps\n0:10 Introducing SOTA and Our Guests\n8:30 Getting Started with Ham Radio\n16:15 Ultralight Equipment for SOTA\n26:45 SOTA Basics and Activation Rules\n36:20 Points, Mountain Goats, and Logging\n43:15 Favorite SOTA Adventures\n51:10 Learning CW and Equipment Tips\n\nUseful SOTA Resources:\nSOTA Website: https://www.sota.org.uk/\nSOTA Atlas: https://sotl.as/map\nTim's Getting Started Guide: https://n7kom.com/SOTA.html\nTim's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@N7KOM\nTim's Etsy Store: https://www.etsy.com/shop/N7KOMPortableRadio\nMatt's QRZ Page: https://www.qrz.com/db/W7MDN\nCascadia Radio Discord: https://www.cascadiaradio.org/\nSOTA Watch Spotting: https://sotamat.com/\nOnX Maps: https://www.onxmaps.com/offroad/app\nCalTopo: https://caltopo.com/\nPeakBagger: https://www.peakbagger.com/\nSOTA Goat Guide: https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/let-sota-goat-guide-you/22487\nLCWO CW Training: https://lcwo.net/\nV-Band CW Practice: https://hamradio.solutions/vband/\nCW Ops: https://cwops.org/\nCW Morse Keys: https://cwmorse.us/\nK6ARK 3D Keys: https://k6ark.com/\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen as Audio Podcast:\nAvailable on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and more\n\ud83d\udd17 All links: https://www.everydayham.com\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Subscribe for More Ham Radio Content!\nHit LIKE if you enjoyed this episode and SUBSCRIBE for discussions on amateur radio, POTA, DXing, contesting, and more!\n\n\ud83c\udf99 Follow Everyday Ham:\nInstagram: @EverydayHamPodcast\nWebsite: www.everydayham.com\n\n#SOTA #SummitsOnTheAir #HamRadio #AmateurRadio #POTA #Ultralight #CW #MountainGoat #PacificNorthwest #PortableRadio #EverydayHam #LNR #MTR3B #Elecraft"
