In just a few years, he went from newcomer to board member of one of the fastest-growing programs in amateur radio. With nearly 50 million QSOs logged, 84,000 registered operators, and 85,000 parks across 236 DX entities, POTA isn\u2019t just thriving\u2014it\u2019s reshaping the hobby.\n\nMark brings something different to the table: four decades of legal and corporate governance experience. At Hyundai, his mission was program integrity\u2014building rules, systems, and internal controls that could withstand explosive growth. Now he\u2019s applying that same mindset to POTA. Not to burden activators and hunters with red tape, but to strengthen the foundation behind the scenes: bylaws, board structure, financial oversight, data privacy protections, and clearer rules that eliminate ambiguity. \u201cIf ten hams interpret a rule and you get twenty-five answers,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to fix that.\u201d\n\nBehind the curtain, a 21-person volunteer development team led by James Linden, VE3JLN, is rewriting the IT backbone\u2014modernizing a decade-old cloud-based system that now processes more than a million QSOs a month. Add to that the financial reality: roughly $5,000\u2013$6,000 per month just to keep the servers running. No corporate sponsor bankrolls this operation. It\u2019s volunteers, modest book royalties, and community donations keeping the engine alive.\n\nAnd yet, the spirit remains intact. Mark tells the story of operating Winter Field Day at minus 15 degrees\u2014three antennas up in an hour\u2014proving that POTA is more than a game. It\u2019s training. It\u2019s readiness. It\u2019s community. His pledge? Make it better without breaking what already works. Stronger governance. Greater transparency.

        "description": "In this DIY ham radio setup tutorial, we will be showcasing a unique and innovative way to create a functional ham radio using 3D printed parts. As a maker and enthusiast of 3D printing, you will learn how to utilize your 3D printer to create useful and functional components for your ham radio setup. We will be using a Bambu Lab A1 mini 3D printer to create the necessary parts, and pairing it with a Baofeng UV-5R mini radio for a compact and efficient setup. This project is perfect for amateur radio operators, preppers, and individuals interested in emergency preparedness, as it provides a reliable means of communication in case of an emergency. With the help of 3D printing, you can create custom components such as radio mounts, antenna holders, and other useful accessories to enhance your ham radio experience. Whether you are a beginner in 3D printing or an experienced maker, this project is a great way to explore the possibilities of 3D printing for beginners and experienced users alike. By following this tutorial, you will be able to create your own DIY ham radio setup with 3D printed parts, and enjoy the benefits of amateur radio communication with a unique and customized setup.",
