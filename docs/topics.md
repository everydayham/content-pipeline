## The Everyday Ham Philosophy

> "Amateur radio from an accessible, non-technical perspective"

**When selecting topics, prioritize:**

1. **Accessibility** - Can a new ham understand and benefit?
2. **Practicality** - Does this help someone get on the air?
3. **Enthusiasm** - Are we genuinely excited about it?
4. **Timeliness** - Is it relevant now?

**Our sweet spot:** Making ham radio approachable without dumbing it down.
